From a small RasperryPi to a cloud instance far away on GCP or AWS. The tree structure enables you to create multiple clusters of resources.\nThe Root Orchestrator manages different clusters of resources. The root only sees aggregated cluster resources. The Cluster orchestrator manages your worker nodes. This component collects the real-time resources and schedules your workloads to the perfect matching device. A Worker is any device where a component called NodeEngine is installed. Each node can support multiple execution environments such as Containers (containerd runtime), MicroVM (containerd runtime), and Unikernels (mirageOS). Did you know?\nSince the stable Accordion release, Oakestra supports both containers and unikernel virtualization targets.\nCreate your first Oakestra cluster Let\u0026rsquo;s start simple with a single node deployment, where all the components are deployed on the same device.\nRequirements\nLinux (Workers only) Docker + Docker compose (Orchestrators only) Cluster Orchestrator and Root Orchestrator machines must be mutually reachable. 1-DOC (1 Device, One Cluster) In this example, we will use a single device to deploy all the components. This is not recommended for production environments, but it is pretty cool for home environments and development.\n0) First, let\u0026rsquo;s export the required environment variables\n## Choose a unique name for your cluster export CLUSTER_NAME=My_Awesome_Cluster ## Come up with a name for the current location export CLUSTER_LOCATION=My_Awesome_Apartment ## Tell the NetManager where to find the system manager export SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL=\u0026lt;IP of device\u0026gt;\rNote\nYou can obtain the public IPv4 address of your device with\ncurl -4 https://ifconfig.co\r1) Clone the repository and move into it using:\ngit clone https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd oakestra\r2) Run a local 1-DOC cluster\nsudo -E docker-compose -f run-a-cluster/1-DOC.yaml up\r3) In another terminal download, untar and install the node engine package\nwget -c https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/releases/download/v0.4.202/NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -xzf NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod +x install.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mv NodeEngine NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./install.sh $(dpkg --print-architecture)\r4) Download, unzip and install the network manager; this enables an overlay network across your services\nwget -c https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra-net/releases/download/v0.4.202/NetManager_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -xzf NetManager_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod +x install.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./install.sh $(dpkg --print-architecture)\r4.1) Edit /etc/netmanager/netcfg.json as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;NodePublicAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;IP ADDRESS OF THIS DEVICE\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NodePublicPort\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;PORT REACHABLE FROM OUTSIDE, use 50103 as default\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClusterUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClusterMqttPort\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10003\u0026#34; }\r4.2) Start the NetManager on port 6000\nsudo NetManager -p 6000 \u0026amp;\r5) Start the NodeEngine\nsudo NodeEngine -n 6000 -p 10100\r( you can use NodeEngine -h for further details )\nM-DOC (M Devices, One Cluster) Now, let\u0026rsquo;s separate the Oakestra components over multiple devices and create a more distributed cluster.\nThe M-DOC deployment enables you to deploy One cluster with multiple worker nodes. The main difference between this deployment and 1-DOC is that the worker nodes might be external here, and there can be multiple of them.\nThe deployment of this kind of cluster is similar to 1-DOC. We first need to start the root and cluster orchestrator. Afterward, we can attach the worker nodes.\n1) On the node you wish to use as a cluster and root orchestrator, execute steps 1-DOC.1 and 1-DOC.2\n2) Now, we need to prepare all the worker nodes. On each worker node, execute the following:\n2.1) Download and unpack both the NodeEngine\nwget -c https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/releases/download/v0.4.202/NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -xzf NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod +x install.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mv NodeEngine NodeEngine_$(dpkg --print-architecture) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./install.sh $(dpkg --print-architecture)\rand the NetManager\nwget -c https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra-net/releases/download/v0.4.202/NetManager_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -xzf NetManager_$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod +x install.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./install.sh $(dpkg --print-architecture)\r2.2) Edit /etc/netmanager/netcfg.json accordingly:\n{ \u0026#34;NodePublicAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;IP ADDRESS OF THIS DEVICE\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NodePublicPort\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;PORT REACHABLE FROM OUTSIDE, internal port is always 50103\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClusterUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;IP ADDRESS OF THE CLUSTER ORCHESTRATOR\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClusterMqttPort\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10003\u0026#34; }\r2.3) Run the NetManager and the NodeEngine components:\nsudo NetManager -p 6000 \u0026amp; sudo NodeEngine -n 6000 -p 10100 -a \u0026lt;IP ADDRESS OF THE CLUSTER ORCHESTRATOR\u0026gt;\rMDNC (M Devices, N Clusters) This represents the most versatile deployment. You can split your resources into multiple clusters within different locations and with different resources. In this deployment, we need to deploy the root and the cluster orchestrator on different nodes. Each independent cluster orchestrator represents a cluster of resources. The worker nodes attached to each cluster are aggregated and seen as a unique big resource from the point of view of the Root. This deployment isolates the resources from the root perspective and delegates the responsibility to the cluster orchestrator. 1) In this first step, we need to deploy the root orchestrator component on a node. To do this, you need to clone the repository on the desired node, move to the root orchestrator folder, and execute the startup command.\ngit clone https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd oakestra sudo -E docker-compose -f root_orchestrator/docker-compose-\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.yml up\r( please replace \u0026lt; arch \u0026gt; with your device architecture: arm or amd64 )\n2) For each node that needs to host a cluster orchestrator, you need to:\n2.1) Export the ENV variables needed to connect to the cluster orchestrator:\nexport SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL=\u0026lt;IP ADDRESS OF THE NODE HOSTING THE ROOT ORCHESTRATOR\u0026gt; export CLUSTER_NAME=\u0026lt;choose a name for your cluster\u0026gt; export CLUSTER_LOCATION=\u0026lt;choose a name for the cluster\u0026#39;s location\u0026gt;\r2.2) Clone the repo and run the cluster orchestrator:\ngit clone https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd oakestra sudo -E docker-compose -f cluster_orchestrator/docker-compose-\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.yml up\r( please replace \u0026lt; arch \u0026gt; with your device architecture: arm or amd64 )\n3) Start and configure each worker as described in M-DOC.2\nHybrid Deployments You should have got the gist now, but if you want, you can build the infrastructure by composing the components like LEGO blocks. Do you want to give your Cluster Orchestrator computational capabilities for the deployment? Deploy an instance of NodeEngine + Netmanager components, and you\u0026rsquo;re done. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to use a separate node for the Root Orchestrator? Simply deploy it all together with a cluster orchestrator.\nWith Oakestra you can build your infrastructure as you like, and you can always scale it up or down as you need!\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":3,"permalink":"/docs/getting-started/deploy-your-first-oakestra-cluster/","summary":"Oakestra lets you deploy your workload on devices of any size.

One Application can encompass multiple services and one user can create multiple applications on one system. Namespaces allow you to create applications and services by the same name in different namespaces, e.g. production and development.\nCreating an Application First you will have to create an application. Choose a concise name, the namespace and optionally a description.\nCreating a Service In the previous section we discussed registering deployment descriptors via the API. This is great for automated deployments, but the SLAs were not designed with human readability in mind. While the dashboard still allows you to upload SLAs as a JSON file, it also provides you with an interactive form.\nOnce you have created an application you can create services. Once again you will have to choose a concise name, a namespace and optionally a description. However this is far from it; system requirements, environmental variables, connection details and much more can be specified here.\nYou will have to choose a virtualization method (Container or Unikernel) and tell Oakestra where it can find your code. Hit save and your service is ready for deployment!\nService Details Once a service has been created and deployed, you can check on it\u0026rsquo;s status and other details.

You can access the APIs at \u0026lt;IP_OF_CLUSTER_ORCHESTRATOR\u0026gt;:10000 You have read and familiarized yourself with the API and Dashboard approaches. The OAK CLI The benefits of using this CLI are:\nEasy installation via pip Native Interface for the Oakestra APIs Eliviates the need to use external thrid-party tools Accelerated \u0026amp; Simpler Workflows Removes the need to memorize necessary API endpoints Automates tedious tasks away E.g. Aquiring the Login Token The CLI commands can be chained together and used in custom scripts CLI Setup You can install the CLI via pip install oak-cli.\nWhen you run the CLI for the first time it will welcome you.\nConfigurating the CLI The OAK CLI supports a growing array of different scenarios based on the concrete Oakestra use case and user preferences.\nThis CLI initially hides many of its commands to avoid overwhelming new users. Additionally, not every user is in need of every available command nor does every command make sense in all situation or environment.\nTo configure the set of shown commands run oak configuration local-machine-purpose.\nFYI - Using Command Shortcuts\nMost oak commands have shorter aliases that enable shorter commands and easier combinations, thus faster workflows.\nE.g. Instead of typing out oak configuration local-machine-purpose. Simply run oak c l.\nThe available alias are shown directly in the -h output.\nThe CLI will ask you a set of questions about your intended use and your target environment. Based on your Yes/No responses it will provide you with the matching set of commands.\nThis configuration is persistently stored on your machine.\nConfiguring your OAK-CLI is optional yet highly recommended. You can always revert your configuration to its initial state.\nFor futher information about configuring the CLI see the CLI Manuals.\nBasic CLI Usage The root command for the CLI is oak\nNeed Help?\nEvery oak CLI command comes with its own help text to support your understanding.\nSimply add --help or -h to any command to find out more.\nWorking with Application SLAs As detailed in the API Approach Oakestra services and their applications are defined in SLAs.\nThe OAK-CLI comes with a set of pre-defined default SLAs.\nAll available SLAs can be inspected via the oak application sla command.\nAll SLAs are stored in your home directory in the oak_cli folder. It gets automatically populated when you install the CLI.\n~/oak_cli ├── SLAs │ ├── blank_app_without_services.json │ ├── default_app_with_services.json │ └── mysla.json ├── .init_flag ├── .oak_cli_config └── addons └── flops └── ...\rTo modify or add new custom SLAs just modify the content of your ~/oak_cli/SLAs folder. E.g. The mysla.json is a custom SLA that we added after installing the CLI.\nManaging Applications Now that we are familiar with the SLAs we can start creating applications based on them.\nRun oak application show (oak a s) to see the currently orchestrated application.\nThe oak application create (oak a c) commands asks you what SLA should be used as the blueprint for the new application and creates that app for you.\nDelete one or all currently running apps via oak application delete (oak a d).\nDeploying Services The services of our applications are not yet deployed.\nTo deploy instances of these services we need to know the service IDs.\nThe IDs are visible when running oak service show.\nClick on your desired Service ID value in the Service ID column and copy it via Ctrl+C.\nTo deploy a new instance run oak service deploy \u0026lt;YOUR_SERVICE_ID\u0026gt;.\nYou can undeploy all instances of a service or only specific ones by providing the appropriate command option oak service undeploy --service-id \u0026lt;YOUR_SERVICE_ID\u0026gt; / --instance-id \u0026lt;INSTANCE_ID\u0026gt;.\nCombine Create \u0026amp; Deploy\nYou can create an application and automatically deploy its services by providing the -d (for deploy) flag to the oak app create (-d) command.\nAdvanced Observation Features\nYou can display apps and services with different levels of vebosity/detail and automatically refresh the display to stay in the know about the latest changes. .\nYou can even display and automatically follow the latest service logs. .\nFor further details and recorded examples see the CLI Manuals.\nFurther Details \u0026amp; All Available Commands Maximize Speed \u0026amp; Convenience\nThe OAK-CLI is powered by Typer which supports tab autocompletion natively.\nThis means that you can press your tab key to either automatically complete the command you are currently typing or get a list of matching available commands.

It exposes 2 sets of APIs: To receive deployment commands from users To handle child Oakestra Clusters The Scheduler calculates a suitable cluster for a given application Mongo is the interface used to access the database. The root manager stores aggregated information on it\u0026rsquo;s child clusters. Oakestra differentiates between Static metadata such as the IP-address, port number, name and location of each cluster Dynamic data such as worker nodes per cluster, total CPU cores and memory, total disk space, GPU capabilities, etc\u0026hellip; Failure and scalability The key drawback of a centralized control plane is that is creates a single point of failure. Oakestra mitigates this by ensuring that the clusters are able to satisfy the SLAs for deployed applications, the only affected functionalities are the deployment of new services and intra-cluster migrations.\nCluster Orchestrator The cluster orchestrator is a twin of the root, with the following distinctions:\nThe scope of the cluster orchestrator the is worker nodes A key duty performed is aggregation. A cluster orchestrator aggregates the worker node resources and obscures the cluster composition to the root MQTT is used for intra-cluster communication Scheduling At each level, schedulers receive job placement tasks and return a placement decision. At the root level a cluster is chosen for a given service. At the cluster level a worker node is chosen.\nA job placement task is comprised of a service with it\u0026rsquo;s instances and resource requirements. Currently placement follows the best-fit algorithm.\nWorker Node A worker node is a machine running the NodeEngine and the NetManager. The former enables the deployment of applications according to the runtimes installed. The latter provides networking components to enable inter-application communication.\nThe NodeEngine is a single binary implemented using Go and is composed of the following modules:\nMQTT: The interface between the worker and the cluster. Deployment commands, node status updates and job updates use this component. Models: Models that describe the nodes and jobs Node: Describes the resources that are transmitted to the cluster. These are decomposed into static resources, which are only transmitted at startup, and dynamic resources, which are periodically updated, e.g. CPU/memory Service: Describes the services that are managed by this worker node, as well as the real-time service usage statistics Jobs: Background jobs that monitor the the status of the worker node and the deployed applications Runtimes: The supported system runtimes.
