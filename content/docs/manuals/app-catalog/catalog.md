Here you'll find some examples of applications with their respective SLA template that you can use right away to test out Oakestra.

## Nginx Client-Server with Load Balancing
![Minecraft Preview](balancing.png)

To test out the balancing capabilities of Oakestra, we can deploy a simple Nginx server with a client that sends requests to the server. By assigning a Round-Robin balanced semantic IP to a Nginx service. When scaling up the Nginx service, the client requests will automatically be balanced across the service's instances.

## Minecraft Server(s) and Browser Client

Features:
- üéÆ Play Minecraft from a browser, no client installation needed (thanks to [WebMC](https://github.com/michaljaz/webmc))
- üë≠ Play multiplayer locally or remotely 
- üñ•Ô∏è Host your Minecraft server ([Openhack](https://github.com/noelbundick/minecraft-server)) and proxy. 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Scale your server instances to handle more users
- üõ†Ô∏è Customize your deployment

## Object Detection Pipeline

You can try out this AR Pipeline composed of three services: 

**Preprocessing**: preprocessing microservice, collects the frames and adapts them for the model.

**Object Detection**: detects the bounding boxes inside the image. If Object Recognition is up and running, it forwards the frames there. Otherwise, it sends the bounding boxes back to the client.

**Object Recognitions**: it receives the frames from object detection. For each bounding box of type "Person" it detects the face features and sends them back to the client.
