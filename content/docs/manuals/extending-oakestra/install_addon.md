Before installing an Addon make sure that the Addons System is running and that the Addon to be installed is published in the Marketplace.

- Verfy that the Addons Engine component is running inside your orchestrator. Visit the [prerequisite section](./prerequisite.md) for more details onto running the Addons Engine component.
- Verify that the Addon is published in the Marketplace. This can be done by sending a `GET` request to `/api/v1/marketplace/addons/{addon_marketplace_id}`. For more details on how to get the `addon_marketplace_id` please use the APIs at `<marketplace-ip>:11102/api/docs.

Installing an addon is a simple step involving sending a `POST` request to the Addons Engine - `/api/v1/addons`. Example of the body of the request could be:
```json
{
  "marketplace_id": "{addon_marketplace_id}"
}
```

## Verify Installation
The Addons Manager will:
- Retrieve the addon from the marketplace.
- Pull the Docker image associated with the addon.
- Deploy and integrate the addon into the Oakestra environment.

You can verify the installation by checking the addonâ€™s status using the Addons Manager API - `[GET] /api/v1/addons/{addons_id}`


## Uninstall an Addon

Simply send a `DELETE` request to the Addons Manager - `/api/v1/addons/{addons_id}`
