# Contributing Overview

**Welcome to Oakestra!** We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our project. This guide provides an overview of how to get started as a contributor. Whether you’re fixing bugs, improving documentation, or developing new features, your contribution is valued and important.

## Our Community Goals

Oakestra is a welcoming, collaborative, and inclusive community. We want Oakestra to be a place where contributors feel empowered to share ideas, ask questions, and grow. All contributors are expected to follow our ~Code of Conduct~ to keep our community positive and open.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.

Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful.

## Code of Conduct

Oakestra is committed to a respectful and inclusive environment. By contributing, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](#link-to-code-of-conduct).

## How You Can Contribute

If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. Alternatively, you can ceck for issues labeled as [“help wanted”](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/labels/help%20wanted) for beginner-friendly feature extensions. As you gain more experience and demonstrate a commitment to evolving Oakestra, you may be granted issue management permissions in the repository.

There are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

1. **Reporting Bugs**  
   Found a bug? Please report it by creating a GitHub issue. Clear and detailed bug reports are invaluable.

2. **Suggesting Features**  
   Have a new feature idea? Feature requests are welcome! Please submit them as GitHub issues with details on why it would be useful and any implementation suggestions.
