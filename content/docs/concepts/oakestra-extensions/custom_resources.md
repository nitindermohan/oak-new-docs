Custom resources in Oakestra extend the system’s API by enabling the dynamic addition of new data types as a colllection of API endpoints. By allowing users to define custom data structures and manage them through the Oakestra API, custom resources provide a way to create specialized workflows and data handling routines tailored to specific needs.

When a new custom resource is defined, it creates endpoints within the Oakestra API dedicated to managing that resource. These endpoints operate similarly to native API resources, enabling users to:
- **Store and retrieve structured data** specific to the custom resource type.
- **Leverage the API** to create, update, and delete instances of the custom resource.

## Controllers
Custom resources operate alongside **controllers**, which are separate components that monitor and manage the state of custom resources. A Controller observes changes in the custom resource data and makes adjustments to ensure the system’s state aligns with the desired configurations stored within these resources. This setup introduces a structured division of responsibility:
- **Custom Resources** handle the storage and retrieval of structured data
- **Controllers** act on this data to manage the system’s state based on the stored configurations.

In Oakestra, a custom controller could be implemented as an [addon](../addons), allowing users to introduce automation and state management functionalities for custom data types without altering the core system.

- **API Flexibility**: Users can introduce new data types and workflows as needed without modifying the core system.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By decoupling data storage from active state management, custom resources and controllers provide a modular, maintainable architecture.
- **Enhanced Automation**: With controllers managing custom resources, Oakestra can automate workflows and maintain system alignment with external configurations, streamlining operations.
